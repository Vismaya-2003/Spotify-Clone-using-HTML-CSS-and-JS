# Music Player Web Application

This is a simple web-based music player built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The player allows users to:

- Play, pause, and skip through a list of predefined songs.
- View song details such as title and duration.
- Use a progress bar to seek within a song.
- Dynamically update the play/pause button and display animations when a song is playing.

The application includes basic styling for user-friendly navigation and utilizes JavaScript to handle event listeners for various playback controls. Perfect for learning the basics of web development with interactive media.
